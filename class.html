                Thank you for joining us and helping on our mission to colonize and bring art to Mars. This will be a two week program where we will teach you everything you need to build your very own solar powered programmed light sculpture!
         
                Welcome Martians!
                 
                Watch the video to learn about Mars and what we will be working on during our journey.

                Today’s project:
                 
                Discord
                Our primary form of communication is through Discord where you will be able to chat with your fellow Martians and ask questions of your coaches.
                 
                Download Discord here
                 
                Create a Martian name for yourself and log on to our Discord channel.
                 
                Next you will need to learn more about Mars and pick a location where you may want to install your light structure.
                 
                You can learn about Mars using these links.
                 
                NASA Mars Facts
                Space.com Mars
                 
                Next think about the kinds of structures you may want to build. Keep in mind we’ll be teaching you some basics, but you may want to build something custom and a reflection of your creativity.
                 
                Sketch out 10 ideas of different shapes and designs. Let your creativity fly and don’t worry there isn’t a right or wrong here, you never know what you might end up using later in the project.
